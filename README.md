# Hardware Tools server code here

Here is my live website link [Hardware Tools](https://tools-manufacturer-ade64.web.app).

- In server side code I use node.js and it's beautiful libreay that is express.js
- This server side code I did data send, data get, data update and data delete.
- For server I use mongodb(no sql database).
- For data send to database I use post api or method
- Data load to the client side and show ui use get api
- For data delete I use delete api
- Sometime I use put or patch api for data update or post or change.
